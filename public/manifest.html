  <h1>Personal Manifest</h1>
    <p>I have one main goal in my life and that is to <u>create a world where people can life as true to their personality as possible</u>
      <br>
        I strongly belief that most personal and societal problems come from people not being able to really be them selve.
        That may sound like an easy explanation, but actually it leads to the increadibly complicated question of how to solve this and how to develop a society where people can live as true to their personality as possible. 
        <br>
        Finding a answer to this question is the reason why I do what I do. It's my personal an intrinsic motivation.
